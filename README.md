# discord-counting-bot
Yet Another General Purpose Discord Counting Bot (YAGPDCB)...maybe perhaps a Term Incrementation Machine (TIM).

# Functionality

TIM is intended to give you the basic functionality of a counting bot, but with a few benefits:
* Open-source functionality, meaning that now you know what you are running on your Discord server, with lower risk of mishaps (server nuking).
* Customization as a result of being open-source.
* This is not your standard counting bot.
